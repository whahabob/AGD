Where am I..
Why is it so hard to think..
Think damn it..!
Who am I..
Where am I..
I need to get out of here..
<WALK BY PRESSING THE WASD KEYS>

Barrels.. Great.
I'm so tired, I don't think I can make space..
Why won't they just.. MOVE!
<PRESS LMB TO SHOUT> & <MMB / SCROLL TO SWAP BETWEEN SHOUTS>

Hmph..
That took the breath right out of me..
Guess I can't shout all the time..
Better catch my breath and hope nothing sneaks up on me..

Fire..
Great..
Guess I won't be going that way then..

What is this..
A glowing.. cirle?
Heh.. Who dares wins.

A gate..?
Must be a way to open it..
If only I remembered how t-
A key! There must be a key!
I better keep looking until I find the right one.

Gates everywhere.. 
Hmpf, Guess i'll keep looking..

A dead end..
Great!
If only I had unlimited batteries for this flashlight!
That way I could keep running into dead ends all night long!
Sigh..

Could've sworn I saw a key..
Must be somewhere between these boxes..
Guess I better search with my flashlight while I still have juice.

Whoa.. dizzy.
What is this place..
I was just.. But..
How?

A battery!
Just the thing I needed..
Maybe god hasn't abandoned me after all..
..
Heh..
And then there was light.
